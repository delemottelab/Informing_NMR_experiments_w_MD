# Getting things properly submited
+ Maybe some figures need to be changed format: jpeg, eps, tiff, pdf
+ Take the contents of bbl and paste them in SI.tex and aip_text.tex replacing the \bibliography command.
+ The SI.aux has to be given in order to have the SI references introduced.
+ Put all the figures in the main folder.
+ In SI.tex change the document class from preprin to draft so you don't need to upload the figures.
